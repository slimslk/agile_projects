Feature: Retrieving information about the User
   As a user
   I want to be able to retrieve information about a specific user
   So that I can view its details

   Scenario: Successfully retrieving information about the user by ID
     Given: User exists with ID "1"
     When: I send a GET-request to "/users/1/"
     Then: I receive a response with status "200 OK"
     And: Response contains the following info:
